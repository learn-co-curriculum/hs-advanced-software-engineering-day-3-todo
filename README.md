## Welcome to Day 3!!!

Today's big goal will be integrating a database into our Sinatra applications! For this morning's ToDo: 

1. If you haven't already, get caught up on your Social Media Recreation project. You should have a form that, when submitted, creates a new instance of your content class. Check out the current Fwitter repository and use it as a guide. 

2. Speaking of Fwitter - once you have your Social Media app updated, go ahead and do the same with Fwitter. The more practice you can get with forms, the better. 

3. Once you have your apps up and running, get some SQL practice  with the Select and Insert lab. You'll get practice reading and writing data into a SQL table called "Cats"

4. We'll be talking about abstraction today. Check out this [article](http://www.artyfactory.com/art_appreciation/animals_in_art/pablo_picasso.htm) about Picasso's bulls.
